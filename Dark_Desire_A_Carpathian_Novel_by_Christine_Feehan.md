Discover the breathtaking power of supernatural love in this darkly sensuous classic from #1 New York Times bestselling author Christine Feehanâ€™s Carpathian series. The stranger silently summoned her across the continents, across the seas. He whispered of eternal torment, of endless hunger . . . of dark, dangerous desires. And somehow American surgeon Shea Oâ€™Halloran could feel his anguish, sense his haunting aloneness, and she ached to heal him, to heal herself. Drawn to the far Carpathian mountains, Shea found a ravaged, raging man, a being like no other. And her soul trembled. For in his burning eyes, his icy heart, she recognized the beloved stranger whoâ€™d already become part of her. The imperious Carpathian male had compelled Shea to his side. But was she to be his healer. . . or his prey? His victim . . . or his mate? Was he luring her into madness . . . or would his dark desire make her whole?

From debut author Anna Adams, this delightful YA romcom is all about finding yourself, your family, and perfect harmony in the big city.
 
 Maude Laurent is an orphan. Raised in Carvin, a small town in northern France, sheâ€™s always wondered about her parentsâ€”who they were and what happened to them. Her foster family, the Ruchets, certainly wonâ€™t tell her anything. For them, sheâ€™s someone to cook meals, clean their house, and look after their twin boys, but Maude dreams of much moreâ€”she dreams of becoming an opera star and singing on the great stages of Paris.
 
 Her Cinderella moment arrives when sheâ€™s livestreamed playing the piano and singing in a cafÃ© during a school trip to Paris. Suddenly sheâ€™s an internet sensation and music studios are pursuing her with promises of stardom. The only problem? They all want her to sing pop, but thatâ€™s not what Maude wants...
 
 When Terence Baldwin and his daughter show up on Maudeâ€™s doorstep, they promise to help her find her own unique voice. Maude accepts the challenge: six months in New York to write and record three singles that become hits. If she succeeds, she can stay and record an album. If she doesnâ€™t, sheâ€™ll return to Carvin.
 
 Maude knows she has the drive and talent to succeed but she also knows that her father used to live in the city. Perhaps, just perhaps, she can have it all: a successful music career and a chance to learn more about her family. Itâ€™s perfect! However, thereâ€™s one big problemâ€”her collaborator Matt Durand. Heâ€™s annoying and arrogant, a popstar on a break, and heâ€™s determined to force Maude out of her comfort zone.
 
 With rival artists determined to see Maude fail and the clock ticking, Maude and Matt have to put their bickering aside if theyâ€™re going to succeed. Then a sudden revelation about Maudeâ€™s parents changes her perspective on everything and leaves her wondering if she can ever find the perfect harmony.

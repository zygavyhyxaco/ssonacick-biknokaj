 More about the Moomins:
 The Moomins are the central characters in a series of books and comic strips by Swedish-speaking Finn Tove Jansson (1914â€“2001), a painter, illustrator and writer. The Moomins are a family of white and roundish fantastical characters, with large snouts. After the first Moomin story published in 1945, Tove Jansson went on to write another eight books, four picture books and numerous comic strip stories about the Moomins. The Moomins have inspired numerous television series, films and theme parks. There is a podcast devoted to Moomins hosted by Lily Collins and Jennifer Saunders - the Moomin Phenomenon podcast, which launched in March 2023.
 
 Moomins are a beloved heritage brand; the first book of eight was published (in Swedish) in 1945 and since then, have sold millions of copies worldwide, in over 40 languages.

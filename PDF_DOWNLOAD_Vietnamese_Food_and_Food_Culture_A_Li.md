 In 2018 veteran restaurateur, author, foodie and all-around travel junkie Paul Kennedy embarked on a life-changing journey to Vietnam. His main goal was to explore the nation&amp;#039;s rich cuisine and food culture, which had always fascinated him from afar, but which he could never quite understand fully.
 
 This book is the result of five years spent traveling the length and breadth of the country, experiencing Vietnamese food up-close as no other food writer has before.

Bestselling author and real estate, television, and media icon Ryan Serhant shares his proven, three-step strategy to build your brand from scratch
 
 Brand is everything. Whether you’re a real estate broker, a hair stylist, or a freelance contractor, your end goal is the same: get leads and generate new business. You want people to think of you the split second they consider looking for a new apartment, getting highlights, or finally redoing that guest bathroom. And while building a brand from scratch sounds daunting, the authentic you is already a brand—you just might not know it yet.
 
 Brand It Like Serhant brings readers through Ryan’s three-step strategy that transformed SERHANT. from that-broker-above-Burger Heaven into the most followed real estate brand in the world. In Phase One, you’ll discover your core identity, from your written brand statement to fonts, colors, posing for photos, and more. In Phase Two, you’ll learn how to deliver consistent content—realistically, by understanding social platforms and making the right choices for your work. And in Phase Three, you’ll shout it from the mountaintops: share your accolades, leverage growth, and achieve your full potential.
 
 Weaving interviews with household names like Gary Vaynerchuk, Rebecca Minkoff, and Mark Manson, custom worksheets to get organized, and a case study of one person’s progress through each chapter, Brand It Like Serhant is textbook, classroom, and teacher rolled into one. Start to finish, Ryan’s actionable guide empowers you to build an authentic, enduring brand by becoming known for what you want to be known for—and skyrocket your career.
